# 👋 Hi, I’m Danny — Retail Data Analyst

I help **retail teams answer the questions that actually matter**:  
*What drives sales? Where are we losing revenue? Which products should be sold together?*

With a background in **Data Analytics**, I specialise in **retail & commercial analytics**, turning transactional data into **actionable insights** — not just charts, but real business decisions.

## 🔹 What I do
- 📈 Analyse **sales trends, product mix, and customer behaviour**  
- 🛒 Identify **cross-sell & basket expansion opportunities**  
- 🎯 Design **KPIs that reflect real retail performance**  
- 📊 Build **executive-ready dashboards** with **SQL, Power BI & Python**  
- ✅ Apply **data quality checks** so decisions are based on **trustworthy data**

## 🧠 How I think about data
> Data is only useful if it **changes a decision**.  

Every project here is structured around:  
**Business question → Analytical logic → Measurable outcome**  
—the same way analytics drives **real retail business impact**.
