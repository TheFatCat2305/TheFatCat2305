👋 Hi, I’m Danny

I’m a Data Analyst with a strong focus on Retail Analytics and Business Intelligence, turning raw transactional data into insights that support commercial decisions, merchandising strategy, and customer growth.

My work sits at the intersection of data, retail operations, and business strategy — from analysing sales performance and product mix, to identifying cross-sell opportunities, monitoring data quality, and building decision-ready dashboards for stakeholders.

I’m particularly interested in:

Retail & e-commerce analytics

Sales performance & customer behaviour analysis

Market basket analysis & cross-sell modelling

Data quality monitoring & KPI design

BI solutions using SQL, Power BI, Python

This GitHub showcases practical, business-driven projects based on real-world retail and commercial datasets, with a focus on clarity, logic, and impact rather than academic theory.

🔍 What you’ll find here

End-to-end retail analytics projects (data → insight → dashboard)

Clean, well-documented SQL & DAX logic

BI dashboards designed for non-technical stakeholders

Experiments with data quality checks, KPI frameworks, and analytical storytelling
