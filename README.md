👋 Hi, I’m Danny — Retail Data Analyst focused on turning sales data into decisions

I help retail teams answer the questions that actually matter:
What’s driving sales? Where are we losing revenue? Which products should be sold together?

With a background in Business Information Systems, I specialise in retail and commercial analytics, using transactional data to uncover customer behaviour, product performance, and revenue opportunities — not just charts for reporting, but insights for action.

My work typically involves:

Analysing sales trends, product mix, and customer purchasing patterns

Identifying cross-sell and basket expansion opportunities

Designing business KPIs that reflect real retail performance

Building clear, executive-ready dashboards with SQL, Power BI, and Python

Applying data quality checks so decisions are based on trustworthy data

This GitHub is a collection of hands-on retail analytics projects, built with real-world datasets and framed from a commercial decision-maker’s perspective — focusing on why the insight matters, not just how the code works.

🧠 How I think about data

Data is only useful if it changes a decision.
Every project here is structured around a business question → analytical logic → measurable outcome, the same way analytics is used in real retail environments.
